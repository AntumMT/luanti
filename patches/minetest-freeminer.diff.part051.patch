+TL;DR
+*****
+
+We don't use the original upstream tarball, but a repacked version.
+It can be easily regenerated by typing:
+
+    make -f debian/rules get-orig-source 
+
+
+Long version
+************
+
+I hate fiddeling with upstream's tarballs, but it seems to be what
+upstream expects of us here, so let's do it. I was about creating
+separate debian packages (at source level) for each parts, but since
+other distros were merging them, I went to upstream IRC channel to
+discuss on their motivation to split the source package. 
+
+emptty:    celeron55: why did you guys separate common and the games
+           from the main tree? 
+celeron55: emptty: common and the games are separated from the engine
+           tree to keep the repositories reasonably sized
+celeron55: common and games contain textures, sounds and 3D models
+           which aren't wanted in the engine repo
+emptty:    Is there any possibility that they get versioned
+           differently? Like a 0.4.6.1 release of minetest_game while
+           the other remain  at 0.4.6 or so.
+celeron55: It is intended that they are identically versioned via git
+           tags.
+
+If so, I see this split as a convinience for the developers, but I
+think that it is expected that we merge the elements back into the
+source package in Debian.
+
+I diregarded the creation of several upstream tarballs as it breaks
+git-buildpackage. I think that a team-managed package must be as much
+automatized as possible. git-buildpackage makes it impossible to have
+dissemblable compilation environment among team members.
